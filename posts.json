    "body": "I'm starting this blog as a public log of my investing journey. The idea is simple: document my research, my process, and my thinking as I learn and grow as an investor.\n\nI want a place where I can look back and see how my ideas evolved over time — what I got right, what I got wrong, and why. Having a record of your own decision-making is one of the most underrated tools in investing.\n\nBut this isn't just for me. I'm putting it out in the open because I believe in learning out loud. If you're on a similar path, I'd love to hear from you — whether that's collaboration, questions, advice, or just a different perspective. The best ideas come from honest conversation.\n\nMore posts coming soon. Stay tuned.",
